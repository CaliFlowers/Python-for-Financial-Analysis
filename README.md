# Python-for-Financial-Analysis
A demonstration of using Python for analyzing financial data. While VBA is a excellent at solving tedium in data analysis, VBA's functionality is limited  by the features available on Microsoft Excel. An open source programming language like Pythonis has become the preffered alternative to fee-for-service Software such as Microsoft Office due to its relative simplicity and flexible functiionality. 

In this mini=project, that functionality is put to use on a simple budget analysis. With a relatively small dataset, this example doesn't seem too different from a VBA analysis. What the analysis does is extract a row-by-row display of data in a csv file. Like in VBA, a for-loop can be applied to perform a clculation on each row, as is done to calculate monthly changes in profitability. Lastly, to round up the for loop, the calculayions in each row are summed up to reveal a healthy company that has 3.8 million dollars over its seven year life, and showing fairly healthy growth ($446,000 a month, on average). 

In addition, Python is also able to extract the superlative months thatshowed the greatest increase ($671,099) and decrease
